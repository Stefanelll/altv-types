the radio with '**' is new in the game i think... because i can't find in this list
the radio with '-> **' is the name in the game, name different from the list (idk if it's good the old one or the one i see in the game)
every radio has an '=' with his own id, for this: 'blablabla.activeRadioStation = id;'
